# H5 Game CMS: Cross-Border Game Management Platform  
A robust, scalable, and user-friendly Content Management System (CMS) tailored exclusively for **overseas H5 game developers and publishers**. This open-source solution streamlines game operation, content management, user analytics, and monetization—all optimized for global markets (with built-in support for multi-language, multi-currency, and mainstream international payment gateways).


## 🌟 Project Overview  
In the fast-growing global H5 game market, developers often grapple with fragmented user management, inefficient content updates, and incompatibility with overseas monetization tools. This H5 Game CMS addresses these pain points by delivering an all-in-one backend system designed specifically for cross-border operations.  

### Key Highlights  
- **Global-First Architecture**: Natively supports 10+ languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Japanese, etc.) and auto-adapts to regional regulations (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA).  
- **Lightweight & High-Performance**: Built with performance-optimized tech stacks to ensure smooth operation, even for small-to-medium game development teams.  
- **Highly Extensible**: Modular design enables seamless integration with third-party tools (analytics platforms, ad networks, CRMs).  
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive API documentation, CLI tools, and a debug mode for rapid customization and troubleshooting.

cd h5-game-cms
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables  
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the following key values (adjust based on your needs):  
```env

```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies & Initialize Database  
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init # Initialize database tables
npx prisma db seed # Seed test data (default admin: admin@example.com / password: Admin123!)

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run Locally  
```bash
# Start backend server (runs on port 4000)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start frontend server (runs on port 3000)
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Access the CMS  
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Log in with the default admin credentials:  
- Email: `admin@example.com`  
- Password: `Admin123!`  

> ⚠️ **Critical**: Change the default admin password immediately after your first login (go to **Settings > Account > Change Password**).  


## 🚢 Production Deployment  

For overseas production environments, we recommend using **Docker Compose** (simplest) or cloud services like AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, or Azure Virtual Machines.  

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Quick Deployment)  
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your server.  
2. Update the `.env` file with production-ready values (e.g., replace `localhost` with your server IP/domain).  
3. Run the following command to start all services:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```  
4. Access the CMS at `http://your-server-ip` or `https://your-domain.com` (after setting up SSL).  

### Option 2: Cloud Deployment (AWS Example)  
1. Launch an EC2 instance (t3.medium or higher) with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  
2. Install Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx on the instance.  
3. Set up SSL with Let’s Encrypt (for HTTPS):  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
   ```  
4. Deploy the app using PM2 (process manager):  
   ```bash
   # Deploy backend
   cd backend
   npm run build
   pm2 start dist/server.js --name "h5-cms-backend"

   # Deploy frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm run build
   pm2 start npm --name "h5-cms-frontend" -- start
   ```  
5. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy (update `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`):  
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       return 301 https://$host$request_uri; # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   }

   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name your-domain.com;

       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;

       # Frontend
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }

       # Backend API
       location /api {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```  
6. Restart Nginx to apply changes:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```
